#When2Meat#

Welcome to the future of meetings (meatings?)

A helpful bookmark that lets you import your Goolge Calendar Events into When2Meet, and adds 80% of your daily protein!

Note: Those who eat vegetarian, vegan, kosher, halal, pescetarian, pesce-pescetarian, and beyond -- we still welcome you to our plugin. No meat was harmed in the making of this process.
